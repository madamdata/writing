The catastrophe in this endeavour is that a sense of place such as the
one I am being invited to cultivate has been endlessly compromised; by
(for instance) the march of capital, the continual cycle of
displacement, ghosts from histories we have turned away from - 

Given different inputs, in a different dream, this could have been a
center of light and motion, ecosystems rather than crypts... but I was born into
the dead. I am continually presented with the dead, and I can only
respond in prayer, and the only prayer I know is speech itself.
