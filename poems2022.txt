"Ode to Canal" 

consider -> people from other countries are always asking
about the weather. I reply: 
"summer, all summer.
all waters. all
bodies. emulsified dirt.
someone by a canal may look 
at you and think: if I were that sweaty,
someone might love me.

dear grace. 
peace. you and me are fluids secreted by this place, and
I am worried about you, because you are not cruel, 
and it is not cruel, and it is nobody's fault,
but the blood keeps coming out.

the other day I read a story about us.
I hate when our contradictions are cast as tragedy. 
you are perfect, outside of any fiction.
when you put one foot in front of the other,
the past and the future become joined. That is the universe.

"kill"

the place I am sitting is a small place

I grow the words 'move the body along,
and the finger tips will follow'

inside: orchids
like cosmic strings.

'red dress'

In bed with food poisoning -
the oscars just aired, stunning
dress, she wore it with the flair
of one who grew up in better air
than here. too bad for the rest of us.
where under our blankets the night chorus
sings its song (it goes like this):
> red dress, take me home
> the antacids will wear off soon, and 
> I'm just a car speeding down the highway, 
> looking for my garage.

'black metal 1'

dripping corpse is the name of our band
one time, we were all on our bicycle
two wheels, two pedals, four legs, six knees
screaming down the street at four a.m.
every street desecrates the name of god,
every liquid flick of the hips.
dragging the rear tire, leaving the skin
on the road, 
and the blood 
on the skin.

'sergeant butthead' 

I once climbed a mountain with a jerry can on my back.
997 kilo per metre cubed - you
see, I am a scholar of weight. Twenty litres gives
a third of my body's mass.   I am
a gentleman.   one day they said punish the men. give em thirty.
I said I am a man too.
they said you know what I mean. Punish
the men I said, sir yes sir 
yes 
yes yes yes

'claw'

claw: 

consider the crab. 
my mum cooks it in chili sauce. mantou
from the store:
	

grace is showing me a magic trick.
her hands curl up like traitors:


consider the crab. 

I spent ninety six hours mostly in bed. 

these (three) sticky, heavy days.


consider the crab.

what is he hiding?

art week 2022

oh god,
here come 
the dances and
with computers inside them
it became a flower we printed on banners
at the airport the smoking gun that is,
the spirit of the era and
the blunt pencil of history and
with sepia and / or coconut leave
the smoking gun and
the water torture and
the river and
the promises and the apps and
one day I crawled into the ocean for this
the forms and 
the dormitories and 
the thing we were looking for, 
it was pressed to our temples
loaded and ready to explode
the panels and
the radio shows and
art without power is 
two actors on a stage and
next year, 
I want the gun.
