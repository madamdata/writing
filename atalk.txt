Hey. thanks for sitting down with me. 

	A pleasure.

How are you feeling?

	Strange, to be aware of the world again. 

Were you not aware? what's it like being dead?

	Oh, there's nothing. It's not strange. It just seems strange now that I'm not dead anymore.

Are you not dead? 

	I'm here talking to you right?

You seem quite calm about this. I didn't know I was raising the dead. I thought we'd just have a chat.

	A chat, while I was dead? How is that supposed to work?

Ok, yes, I should have thought about that beforehand.

	So, what would you like to talk about?

Oh, I have a list of questions.

	Please, go ahead.

Did you own slaves?

	Yes I did. 

Why? 

	That's how you run a business.

Did you think it was wrong?

	No, I treated them well.

But you don't think owning another person is wrong?

	No, they all did something to deserve it. 

And that is just, to you?

	It is how it is.

How would you like to be owned by someone else?

	I would not like it at all. It would be undignified and humiliating.

But you did it to other people. 

	They were different from me. They deserved it. Some were happy with their place in the world.

Could you kill them if you wanted to, without consequences?

	Yes, of course. They were my property. I didn't, though. I'm not a cruel man. 

I think it is abominable to own a person.

	Ah, times have changed then. In some way I am glad. But I don't care too much; you do what you think is right. 

Could I ever change your mind?

	What's the point? Me and my slaves are all dead. Or I will be, again, once we're done here. 

Do you think the past will never change?

	Of course it never changes. 

Do you remember a person you owned whose name was Xi? 

	There were three or four, which one?

He was the shortest.

	Yes, I remember him. You have been doing research? Are you a scholar?

It's not important. 

	Are you trying to change the past?

I'm not a scholar. 

	Why do you ask about Xi then? 

Do you remember what he looked like?

	A bit. He was short like you said; he had a big nose like yours, and he was very strong. He had big ankles. 

I remember him too.

	How can you remember him? He is long dead. 

So? I remembered you. 

	You can't have. 

How do you think you are here, talking to me? 

	So you are a priest.

I am not a priest. 

	Now I'm curious! This is a good game to play -  

Was he happy?

	He had a family. He sang sometimes, and he seemed happy then. 

You are right; he was happy. He had a daughter and he loved her and he watched her grow up.

	You must have talked to him before me, then. 

Did you think owning him was just, because he was happy? 

	I am beginning to think you are a medium on some kind of mission. I don't know! At least he didn't suffer. 

How do you know that?

	You just said he was happy. 

...

	What?

He was not allowed to see the injustice of being owned, even though it was real, and it reverberated. 

	Like I said, do what you think is right. I don't care what you think. 

His children were slaves too. His descendants were poor; some died of malaria that came from the south. Many suffered. 

	Why are you telling me this? You can't change the past. And I don't care.

	Who are you?

Your descendant.

	Yes, otherwise you couldn't summon me. You must be Xi's descendant too? Times have indeed changed. Why did you bring me here then?

I just wanted to see if you could change. 

	You cannot change the past. And I am the past. You think I did unjust things. Clearly times have changed, unless you are a deviant. 

I am not a deviant.

	Then yes.

I remember you. 

	That's impossible. You cannot remember things from before you were born. 

If I told you times had not changed, would you believe me? 

	I don't think so. If many people think like you do, the world must be very different. 

	Why am I here? What's the point of this talk, Ada? Clearly you have a point you are trying to make.

How did you know my name was Ada?

	Of course it's Ada.

You've never met me before. 

	I remember you.

How can you remember me? You can't remember things from your future.

	I don't know! It's some kind of trick you are pulling. I'm starting to think you called me here to torment me, because you think I was an evil man.

It's true that I think you were an evil man. You also didn't know any better. 

	How can I be evil then?

That's a question for the philosophers. But I am not here to torment you.

	In that case, let me be dead again. It's not so bad. But why do I remember you?

Because you thought the future was a black hole where you could deposit your injustice.

	So you ARE a philosopher! I hate philosophers.

You think people who don't remember you couldn't suffer because of you. 

	I'm sorry you are angry. I'm sorry people suffered; I didn't want that. Maybe I didn't think - but I'm dead and it's over, so why should I care anymore?

But you remember me.

	I remember you. Why do I remember you?

I remember you.

Good. 

Did you know we are on a spaceship?

	You don't answer my questions. You remind me of my school teacher.

You don't answer my questions either!

	Ok, fine. No, what is a spaceship?

Like a boat, but it travels between the stars.

	What? I don't understand you. 

I apologize; I misread your cosmology. The stars are places, just like the sea and the other countrties. We are going there. 

	How can you do that? Do you have magician like the ones in the court?

Yes, they might as well be. Some days they call me a witch. But I didn't make the ship. 

	Which star are we going to? 

A dead one. Or, more correctly, a planet floating above a dead one. 

	Of all the stars in the sky, you chose a dead one?
