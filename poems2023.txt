dear doctor, 
the medicine makes me sick.
i have been unwell for sometime - 

dear doctor, 
when ostensibly, 
it was your job to again 
make me tick,
the clock stopped. 

I'm awake in bed on a work day - 
blankets spread warm, I talk shop
with the others on my phone,
like a ghost
or a dream
or a trick 

dear doctor, you thought that you were slick - 
and that's below you, 
but it crashed my stock. sometimes, 
I think we could know love 
if you knew me the way 
I knew the way.

but in the end, there's no path for us - 
it's the pills 
or it's the vomit, 
you pick.

'necromancer' 

you hid the bodies in the sand
that the owners of the bodies dug

What does the liturgy say about this,
the sin bestowed on the unknowing?
you said it was GDP,
you said it was ours.

a square kilometre of
nothing but one millimetre
after
another

not in my name,
you hid the bodies
the bodies that dug the sand, 
the bodies that owned
	the sand
not in my name: me 
-  at the beach in the hat 
-  on a bench at a park

with the bucket (9 years old, 
chubby with the beauty of suns)
you hid the bodies 
that dug the sand 
castles. but not mine, I'm just the bucketeer,
the soldier 

What does the church say about the sin bestowed on the children? 
you hid the bodies in the sand:
I hope they rise up.
I hope we die.

'in 2023'

in 2023,

I experienced all kinds of rain

I became a kind of refracted thing

I stuck my hands into : 
- sockets
- pussies
- amplifiers
I began to want to return to the ocean 
as a crab hiding 
in a dog food can, 
telling them the art can go fuck itself
- despite my convictions, I fucked the art.

I got on a bike and prayed that speed outweighs grief
it doesn't but the experiment was a work of 
- - pure intellect

I got hungry again
I turned my eyes around this desolation, and dragged my dead shell down the beach, 
limb by 
limb by 
limb by 
limb by 
limb by 
limb by 
limb by 
limb by
limb by 
limb.

"notes on sabbatical"

so little here feels like
    rain
although it 
    rains
all the time 

and looking at
all your fucking
    faces
doesn't help one bit

and that's sad so I am going
    away
and I plan to be alive at the end
    of it
so put the phone
   down

'tell me is'

tell me is a 
flower is a flower
is a flower

cold and bright
is there
the ice of your colour

sweet and dry 
upon the day grows 
the root where 
violet and turqoise
become the sky

'dad' (for ada lovelace) 

hey son:
I just moved to the estate in L.L.
the trees are 
fantastic

the neighbour's kinda 
cute, think he's on the market, I should
ask him over for
crumpets or 
something

I feel new here. I feel like I could be
someone else. 

and sitting among the trees 
don't you know
I miss you ('so much' struck through) terribly? 

at work they have invented a new thing
for the computers: 
they call it difference - 

you put into it the universe,
and it gives you back another

in this one, I'm sitting among the trees too.
but swapped, one for zero
age for age

'true story I'

i hate the computers
i hate the robots
and the cars and the citizens
i hate the flowers and
the buildings
i hate what is above and what is within.
all of the states and all of the birds,
i hate them too, equally with 
the marshes
the blogs
the pigeons (i do not consider them birds)
i hate the smell of the fires
when they burn money for the dead
i guess they 
could use the company
i hate the creatures in the ocean and the roads
and the cables that connect us,
one by one, 
into a ball comprised of nothing but coercion
