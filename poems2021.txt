“a hole” 

I have been raising a garden 
Of every essay on queer art and politics (first three paragraphs)
All this while, 
in the dark northeast corner of the room I borrow from my dad, 
There is a thing - 
a ghost process, 
every week it has grown
and it is singing to somewhere -

“art week 2021” 

so I am saying “I’m not sure there is an art of computation,
so much as 
computing art produces wounds we must resolve”
but this fucking guy 
wants a program that takes the universe as its input,
and returns a new one, 
with him in it.

“leaving Philadelphia” 

pacific ocean,
container of the wetness of my dreams, 
colder and harsher than the other one,
home of the islands of the war and the dreams 
of the islands in the war -

sadly, when I left Philadelphia, 
I took the other
			way
					home

"Final Jeopardy"

If I 
step into the same river twice, 
am I forgiven?

every hour, 
I think
about how
every hour

an hour
from now
but only
every minute
could be
two hours

"grinder"

here in this workshop,
32, 
I become obsessed with 
how soft my hands are

tired and raw, finding
a way home at the end of
train's schedule

under yellow illumination-
I grew up with the tics, foot tic,
dragging my right toe, 
writing the shadows in streetlamps

I push the ground away,
or I scrape its skin
Or it's my turn to be the ground today

toe drag
millimeter by millimeter,
grinding the sole
off, the 
only work 
I know
to do

"referring to me"

(referring to me)
she thinks music emits from the mind
when the only thing that ever brought her pleasure
was the dance of fingers

(referring to music)
at the beginning
was not a will but a machine
that sang the song of the universe -

(referring to machines)
sometimes they touch,
sometimes they don't;
between that and the other
is every note I have ever 
or will produce

(referring to me)
I cannot produce music
from such dusty stuff
as consciousness
I can only linger on
the skin
I gave to you as a gift. 

(referring to me)
between that and the other,
prior to any notion I might have
of myself,
is every sound I can think of, 
and nothing else
