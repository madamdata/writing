Jameson tosses a handheld tool to me. A long power cord clatters to the floor as I catch it. 
"What's this, Jame? New rock cutter? Looks kinda old to me." 
"Old rock cutter." 
I squint at the markings on the device. It's shaped like a pistol, but snubbed at the end, almost like a cop's radar gun 
or a barcode scanner. 
"Dude, this is from like a decade ago, where'd you dig this shit up?" 
"Evi, this is pre SafeLock." 
"...and? I feel like I'm missing your point."
"This runs the last firmware version before it was locked down. It was too old to be updated, so they moved on to a new model... 
but they didn't know we'd had it cracked for months. And I managed to make a few 'disappear' during the recall." 
"Ok, so?" 

Jameson produces another identical cutter and points it at a beer can perched on a box of mining tools across the room. He pulls the trigger. 
With an unbelievably loud bang, it disappears into a mist of steam and metal shards.

"Baby now heats anything, not just rock."
"Wait. People?"
"Yeah, people. Evi?" 
"Yeah?"
"Let's get out of here. Let's go home." 
Moving slowly, he wraps the power cord around my waist and plugs it into the power bank on my back. There's a look on his face, which is almost a smile and almost a frown. He levels his cutter down the corridor to the guards' room, waves me to follow - and sinks into the shadows.
